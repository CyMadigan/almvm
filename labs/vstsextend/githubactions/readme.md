## Overview 

**GitHub Actions** gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

With **GitHub Actions** you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository. GitHub Actions powers GitHub's built-in continuous integration service.

 

### Whatâ€™s covered in this lab
In this lab, you will see

1. How to set up a workflow with GitHub Actions
1. Create a workflow to Build and Deploy a sample .Net Core web application to Azure App Services

### Before you begin

We are excited you want to learn how to use **GitHub Actions** for your automated workflow.

Before you start following the lab, you need to complete the below tasks.

### Prerequisites

1. You will need a **GitHub** account. If you do not have one, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com/join)

1. **Microsoft Azure Account**: You will need a valid and active Azure account for this lab. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

### Setting up the GitHub repository

**Parts Unlimited** is an example ASP.NET Core eCommerce website site. Let us fork the Parts Unlimited repository to get started with this lab.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the [sriramdasbalaji/PartsUnlimited-Core](https://github.com/sriramdasbalaji/PartsUnlimited-Core.git) repository.

1. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

    ![](images/fork_button.png)

    Now, you have a fork of the original [sriramdasbalaji/PartsUnlimited-Core](https://github.com/sriramdasbalaji/PartsUnlimited-Core.git) repository.

## Task 1: Set up a workflow to Build and Test your project with GitHub Actions

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository which you cloned above.

1. Select **Actions**.

   ![](images/githubactions_button.png)

1. You will see some predefined workflows to help you to get started with GitHub Actions
  
   ![](images/workflows.png)

1. For this lab select **Set up a workflow yourself** from the right top corner of the page.

   ![](images/setupworkflowyourself.png)

1. You can see that at the root of your repository, it created a directory named `.github/workflows` to store your workflow files. And it will add a `.yml` or `.yaml` file for your workflow.

      ![](images/initialworkflow.png)

    >For workflow syntax for GitHub Actions see [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

1. Rename the `main.yml` to `PartsUnlimitedWorkflow.yml` and replace the content of the workflow with below YAML snippet.

   ```yaml
   name: PartsUnlimited- Deployment Workflow

   on: [push]

   jobs:
     build:

       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v1
       - name: Setup .NET Core
         uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
         with:
           dotnet-version: 2.2.108
       - name: Restore with dotnet
         run: dotnet restore
       - name: Build with dotnet
         run: dotnet build
       - name: Test with dotnet
         run: dotnet test
       - name: Publish with dotnet
         run: dotnet publish -c release

    ```
1. Now your file should look like as below
  
    ![](images/pulworkflow-ci.png)

1. Let us get into the details of the workflow.

   - **Workflow Triggers**: Your workflow is set up to run on push events to the branch
     
     ```yaml
        on: [push]
     ```
    
      You can set your workflow to run on push events to specific branches as well. For example to the `master` and `release/*` branches

      ```yaml
      on:
      push:
      branches:
      - master
      - release/*
      ```
     For more information, see [Events that trigger workflows](https://help.github.com/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows).
   
   - **Running your jobs on hosted runners:** GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS. We specified hosted runner in our workflow as below.

       ```yaml
       jobs:
       build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      ```
   - **Using an action**: Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action.
      
      ```yaml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
       - name: Setup .NET Core
         uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
         with:
           dotnet-version: 2.2.108
      ```

   - **Running a command**: You can run commands on the job's virtual machine. We are running below dotnet commands to restore, build, test and publish our application.

      ```yaml
       - name: Restore with dotnet
         run: dotnet restore
       - name: Build with dotnet
         run: dotnet build
       - name: Test with dotnet
         run: dotnet test
       - name: Publish with dotnet
         run: dotnet publish -c release
     ```

1. Click on **Start Commit** to push the changes. Since the workflow is configured to trigger on push events, your workflow will be queued when commit is done. 

    ![](images/commitworkflow.png)
  
1. Once you commit the file to navigate back to **Actions** tab. You would see workflow is queued. 

    ![](images/workflowqueued.png)

1. Click on workflow to see the progress of the run.

   ![](images/workflowprogress.png)

1. Workflow status details
    
    ![](images/workflowprogressdetails.png)


Now you have created a GitHub workflow to Build, Test and Publish your .Net core application on every push.


## Task 2: Configure deployment credentials (Azure) in GitHub secrets

Once the build is a success, we would like to deploy the application to Azure App services. For any credentials like Azure Service Principal, Publish Profile etc we need to add them as [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

1. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Launch the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cloud-shell/overview) from the Azure portal and choose Bash.

1. Create a Resource Group. Replace `<region>` with the region of your choosing, for example, eastus.

    ```bash
    az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location <region>
    ```

1. Run the below [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) command to create Azure Service Principal for deployment. Replace `{subscriptionid}` and `{resource-group}` with your Azure subscription id and Resource group name which you created above.

   ```bash  

   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                            --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \
                            --sdk-auth
   ```
1. The command should output a JSON object as shown in the below image. Copy the JSON output to notepad.

    ![](images/azureserviceprincipal.png)

1. Now navigate to your GitHub repository. Select repository **Settings**.

   ![](images/reposettings.png)

1. Select **Secrets** and click on **Add a new Secret**
    
    ![](images/githubsecrets.png)

1. Enter the secret name as **AzureCredentials** and paste the JSON output we copied earlier in **Value**. Click on **Add Secret**.

    ![](images/addsecret.png)

## Task 3: Automate the deployment to Azure

Let's update the workflow to create and update the application Azure App service.

1. Open the file `.github/workflows/PartsUnlimitedWorkflow.yml` from your repository to update.

1. Copy the below yaml snippet at end of the file.

   ```yaml
    - uses: azure/actions/login@master

      with:

        creds: ${{ secrets.AzureCredentials }}
    - name: Create or Update Resources
      run: |
           az appservice plan create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyappservicePlan --sku S1
           az webapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --plan MyappservicePlan --name PartsUnlmitedWeb2610
    - name: 'Run Azure webapp deploy action'
      uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v1
      with: 
        app-name: PartsUnlmitedWeb2610 # Replace with your app name
        package: './src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/publish/'
       
      ```

      ![](images/webappyaml.png)
1. Let's get into the details of the above YAML snippet.

   -  **Azure login action to run `az cli`**: We are using [GitHub Azure Actions](https://github.com/Azure/actions/blob/master/README.md) to login to Azure with the credentials stored in GitHub secrets which you created in the previous task.

       ```yaml
        - uses: azure/actions/login@master

          with:

            creds: ${{ secrets.AzureCredentials }}
       ```
    - **Create Azure Resources**: And then we are trying to create an Azure App Service plan and an Azure Web App to deploy our application by running `az cli` commands.
       
       ```yaml

       - name: Create or Update Resources
      run: |
           az appservice plan create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyappservicePlan --sku S1

           az webapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --plan MyappservicePlan --name PartsUnlmitedWeb2610
        ```
      > Use the same resource group which you created in previous exercise step3 and Web App name should be unique.

      > Azure CLI won't create the resources if they already exist.

    - **Deploy the application**: Using [GitHub Action for deploying to Azure Web App](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy), we will deploy the application to Azure Web App.

      ```yaml
        - name: 'Run Azure webapp deploy action'
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v1
        with: 
        app-name: PartsUnlmitedWeb2610 # Replace with your app name
        package: './src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/publish/'
      ```
1. Now your complete `PartsUnlimitedWorkflow.yml` will look like below

     ```yaml
     name: PartsUnlimited- Deployment Workflow

     on: [push]

     jobs:
         build:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v1
            - name: Setup .NET Core
              uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
              with:
                dotnet-version: 2.2.108
            - name: Restore with dotnet
              run: dotnet restore
            - name: Build with dotnet
              run: dotnet build
            - name: Test with dotnet
              run: dotnet test
            - name: Publish with dotnet
              run: dotnet publish -c release
        
            - uses: azure/actions/login@master

              with:

                creds: ${{ secrets.AzureCredentials }}
            - name: Create or Update Resources
              run: |
                az appservice plan create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyappservicePlan --sku S1
                az webapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --plan MyappservicePlan --name PartsUnlmitedWeb2610
            - name: 'Run Azure webapp deploy action'
              uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v1
              with: 
                app-name: PartsUnlmitedWeb2610 # Replace with your app name
                package: './src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/publish/'
      ```

1. Click on **Start Commit** to push the changes. Since the workflow is configured to trigger on push events, your workflow will be queued when commit is done. 

     ![](images/commitchanges.png)

1. Once you commit the changes navigate back to **Actions** tab. You would see workflow is queued. Wait for the job to complete successfully.

    ![](images/workflowdeploy.png)

1. Now navigate to your Azure portal. You will see an Azure App Service plan and Azure Web App are created in the resource group.

     ![](images/azureresources.png)

1. Select the Azure web app and browse to view the application deployed. 

     ![](images/browseapp.png)

   Your application looks like below

     ![](images/webappview.png)
